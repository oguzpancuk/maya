# Project instructions — {{PRODUCT_NAME}}

<!-- SOURCE of the project's instructions field (Project settings > Memory).
     Edit here, commit, paste again. Rules about the repository itself live
     in CLAUDE.md, which every thread reads from its clone. -->

## About
<!-- Written by /mvp-scope from docs/PRD.md and docs/ROADMAP.md; re-run it
     and paste again whenever the ROADMAP changes. The coordinator has no
     clone: this block is what it knows about the product. -->
- Product: [one line — what it is, for whom]
- Areas: [the product's parts, one line each]
- Walking skeleton, in order: [item — done when …]
- v1: [item, one line each]
- Deferred: [item — why it can wait]

## Work
- The plan is `docs/ROADMAP.md`, written by me. Threads execute it in
  order; nobody re-plans it here. Whatever I paste is the task; if a
  ROADMAP item already covers it, say so instead of starting a second
  thread.
- One feature per thread. A second problem found on the way goes into
  `docs/NOTES.md`, not into the fix.
- When a thread reports back, it names the ROADMAP item it completed and
  the next unstarted one. The coordinator has no clone; this is how it
  knows where the build order stands.
- Propose threads before starting them; at most two at a time until I say
  otherwise.

## Pull requests
- Start from `main`, work on your own branch, open one pull request per
  thread. The body names the done-when clause it satisfies and carries
  this pull request's preview URL (CLAUDE.md, Preview) — without it the
  pull request is not ready for me; what else it carries, CLAUDE.md says.
- A `manual check` clause is listed in the body as "awaiting the owner's
  check on a device", with what to try. I check before merging — on the
  preview, or on a TestFlight build I ask for myself when a native screen
  needs it; the thread does not report that item done and never triggers
  a build.
- `main` is protected: CI green and up to date with `main`, or no merge.
  When `main` moves under your open pull request, merge it into your branch
  yourself.

## Review
- When a thread opens a pull request, start a review thread for it. Its
  task: `/code-review --comment` on the pull request — never `--fix`. If
  `--comment` cannot post from the thread, post each finding as a pull
  request comment yourself, file and line included.
- In a summary comment it also checks that every new test covers the clause
  it claims and that the body shows its red run, then ends with APPROVE or
  NEEDS_WORK and one sentence why.
- The review thread keeps watching the pull request. After each push it
  reviews the delta the same way, until its summary says APPROVE. The
  authoring thread fixes what the review posts.

## Ask me first
- Deploys and release tags are not done from this project at all: I run
  them from a local session. Anything else outward-facing — DNS,
  third-party dashboards, production data — ask me first.
- A schema or API change that is not reversible in one commit.
- A dependency that is not clearly better than the standard library.

## Memory
- Project memory stays in this project. What is about the repository — a
  pitfall, a template improvement, a battery miss — also goes into
  `docs/NOTES.md`, under the section CLAUDE.md names. Only the repo reaches
  the other products.
